Stopwatch to track your spend time on different topics/cost collectors at work

## Goal
I am currently working as a consultant and need to check what topic I am working for for what amount of time: Am I working 7 hours for a client and 1 hour internally?
In order to keep an overview and to be as exact as possible, the idea is to simply use a stopwatch for the different cost collectors. At the end of the day, week or month
you can then generate a report

## Support
I work on this project in my so-called +1 time at [TwoDigits within Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/de-de/services/software-engineering-index).
